# Advanced testing, mocking, integration
## Tasks
Here is listed the task that I have done.
### REENGINEER
Task:

Take an existing implemented small app with GUI, e.g. an OOP exam. Add a requirement that it outputs to console some relevant
messages, through a log class. Now you have an App with at least 3 classes (GUI, Model, Log). How would you write integration tests
for it? Search here: https://bitbucket.org/mviroli/oop2023-esami (2023, 2022,. . . )

### Gherkin Test (self-made)
Task:

User Gherkin for integration tests, here you can find all the tests:
* integration.feature
* StepLogic.java
